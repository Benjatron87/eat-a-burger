# Eat-A-Burger

## Eat-A-Burger is an application that utilizes node.js with express-handlebars and MySql.

### In this app the user can add a burger to their plate and then, with the press of a button, eat said burger.

### The overall concept is simple, but the purpose of the app was to get my feet wet using MySql along with node.js and express to properly use data from a database on the server side and then deploy it on the front end.
